# Getting started ðŸš€

The application you have developed uses React and Vite.js which is a modern development tool that allows you to serve your application during development with an extremely fast hot reload time. 



This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

#Prerequisites ðŸ“‹

- Node.js versiÃ³n 16.15.0.
- For the project, Visual Studio Code was used as a text editor to develop the design.

```
Then go to the cloned folder in the "Design-Chicks-Challenge" repository.
For a Windows operating system, with the command:
